# Streamlit-Project

A Streamlit app for exploring and modeling the **German Credit dataset**.  
This project demonstrates **data visualization**, **ML classification with CatBoost**, **CI testing with GitHub Actions**, and **Docker containerization**.

## Process
- Data preprocessing (duplicate removal, feature encoding)
- Exploratory visualizations:
  - Risk vs. Sex
  - Risk vs. Credit History
  - Risk vs. Employment Duration
- CatBoost classification model with configurable threshold
- Confusion matrix and classification report (precision/recall/f1)
- Automated tests with `pytest`
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone
